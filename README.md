 Lead Management Automation

Welcome to my Lead Management Automation project! This repository shows how I created an automated workflow to capture, store, and communicate with leads efficiently using tools like Google Forms, Zapier, Google Sheets, and Gmail.


 üìù Project Description

This project was designed for a fictional digital marketing agency. The goal was to optimize the lead capture process, eliminating manual tasks and improving the customer experience. Every time a lead completes a form in Google Forms, their data is automatically sent to Google Sheets for management, and they receive a personalized welcome email via Gmail.


 üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Google Forms**: To capture lead data (name, email, phone, etc.).  
- Zapier**: To automate the workflow.  
- Google Sheets: To store and manage leads.  
- Gmail**: To send personalized welcome emails.  


 üöÄ How It Works

1. Lead Capture:  
   Leads complete a Google Form with their personal and contact information.  

2. Automation with Zapier:  
   - Trigger: When a new response is submitted in Google Forms.  
   - Action 1: Lead data is sent to HubSpot (or Google Sheets) for storage.  
   - Action 2: A personalized welcome email is sent via Gmail.  

3. Results:  
   - Leads are automatically stored in a database.  
   - Leads receive a personalized welcome email within seconds.
